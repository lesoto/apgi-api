"""
Longitudinal metrics: ICC, SEM, MDC95, computed per repeated-measures index
(Phase 5, governing doc §5.2).

Design choice, stated plainly rather than buried in a formula: this
implements ICC(1,1) (one-way random-effects, single measurement, absolute
agreement) via the classic one-way ANOVA decomposition — the simplest
defensible model when there is no reason to treat "session index" itself as
a systematic fixed effect shared identically across subjects (a two-way
model would be more appropriate if e.g. every subject is assessed on
exactly the same calendar occasions). Revisit this choice before the
"calibrated" release gate if the actual repeated-measures design turns out
to have a shared-occasion structure ICC(2,1)/ICC(3,1) would model better.

Requires a balanced design: exactly `k` measurements per subject, achieved
by the caller intersecting to a fixed pair (or set) of session_index values
before calling in (app/routes/longitudinal.py filters to sessions having
scores at both requested indices).
