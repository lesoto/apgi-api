## What is Consciousness?

Before understanding APGI, let's define consciousness. Philosophers and neuroscientists have debated this for centuries, but in computational neuroscience, we focus on:

**Consciousness as Integrated Information**: The degree to which a system integrates information across distributed networks.

Key properties of conscious experience:
- **Unified**: Feels like a single experience, not fragmented pieces
- **Selective**: We're aware of some things, not others
- **Dynamic**: Changes moment to moment
- **Effortful**: Requires resources and attention
- **Reportable**: We can talk about what we're conscious of

Traditional neuroscience correlates consciousness with:
- Activity in the thalamocortical system
- Synchronized oscillations across brain regions
- Integrated information across neural networks

**APGI's perspective**: Consciousness emerges from *how* information flows, not just *where* it flows.

## Core APGI Concepts

### 1. Allostasis

**Definition**: Dynamic regulation of internal states to achieve goals in a changing environment.

Difference from *Homeostasis*:
- **Homeostasis**: "Keep things stable" (e.g., constant body temperature)
- **Allostasis**: "Anticipate and adapt" (e.g., raise metabolism before exercise)

In APGI, allostasis means:
- The brain maintains predictive models of the world
- It gates information based on current needs and predictions
- It prioritizes some signals over others dynamically

**Example**: When you're focused on a conversation (conscious attention), you don't notice background noise (gated out). But if you hear your name, the gate opens (gating value increases) because it's allostatic—your brain predicted this might be important.

### 2. Precision Gating

**Definition**: Selective filtering of sensory and cognitive information based on predictive uncertainty.

The brain can't process everything—there's too much information. So it gates (filters) information:

```
Raw Input Signal → [Precision Gate] → Passed to Higher Processing
                        ↓
                   Gating Value (0-1)
                   0 = fully blocked
                   0.5 = partial attention
                   1 = full attention
```

**Precision value** indicates how certain the brain is that this information matters:
- High precision (close to 1): "This signal is important, pass it through"
- Low precision (close to 0): "This is noise or irrelevant, filter it out"

**Sources of gating precision**:
1. **Top-down** (expectations): "I'm expecting an important signal"
2. **Bottom-up** (salience): "This signal is very novel or emotionally significant"
3. **Attentional** (goals): "This is relevant to my current goal"

### 3. Ignition Events

**Definition**: Coordinated, synchronized activation of distributed brain networks.

When multiple brain regions activate together in a synchronized pattern, an "ignition event" occurs. This is the neural signature of consciousness.

Think of ignition like:
- **Before ignition**: Different brain regions operating somewhat independently
- **During ignition**: Networks synchronize, creating high integration
- **Consciousness emerges**: The synchronized state corresponds to conscious awareness

**Mathematical perspective**:
```
Consciousness = f(Integration, Differentiation)
              = How much information is integrated across networks
              + How much information is differentiated (specialized)
```

### 4. State Dynamics

APGI models how the system transitions between states:

```
[RESTING] → [IGNITION_THRESHOLD] → [CONSCIOUS] → [FADING] → [RESTING]
             (precision gates open)              (attention shifts)
```

**Key insight**: Consciousness is not binary (on/off) but continuous and dynamic.

**State characteristics**:

| State | Precision Gates | Integration | Integration | Reportability |
|-------|-----------------|-------------|-------------|---|
| Unconscious | Low (closed) | Low | High | Can't report |
| Threshold | Increasing | Medium | Medium | Vague awareness |
| Conscious | High (open) | High | Medium | Clear report |
| Reduced | High→Low | High→Low | High | Fading awareness |

## How APGI Models Consciousness

### The APGI Equation (Simplified)

```
Consciousness(t) = Sum of [Precision_Gate(i) × Signal(i) × Synchrony(t)]
                   for all regions i
```

Breaking this down:
- **Precision_Gate(i)**: How much is region i's signal gated (0-1)
- **Signal(i)**: Current activity level of region i
- **Synchrony(t)**: How synchronized all regions are at time t
- **Consciousness(t)**: Resulting consciousness level at time t

## APGI System Architecture

### Conceptual Layers

The APGI system has multiple nested layers of organization:

```
[Conscious Experience & Report]
              ↑
[Global Synchrony & Ignition]
              ↑
[Precision Gating & Information Flow]
              ↑
[Allostatic Prediction & Expectation]
              ↑
[Sensory Input & Environmental Context]
```

### Computational Representation

In our API, we represent APGI with:

```python
class APGISession:
    """A simulation of APGI consciousness dynamics"""

    configuration: Config          # Parameters defining the system
    state: dict                    # Current state (positions, activations, etc.)
    precision_gates: dict          # Current gating values per region
    synchrony_level: float         # Current network synchronization (0-1)
    consciousness_level: float     # Derived consciousness metric (0-1)
    history: list                  # Record of state transitions
```

## From Theory to Code

### How Concepts Map to the API

| APGI Concept | API Representation |
|---|---|
| **APGI System** | `Session` object in database |
| **Configuration** | `config` field of Session (JSON) |
| **System State** | `full_state` field of Session (JSON) |
| **Precision Gates** | `parameters` field of Task |
| **Consciousness Level** | Computed metric in session results |
| **Ignition Event** | State transition event (tracked in history) |
| **Experiment** | `Task` (long-running async computation) |

### Session Lifecycle

```
User creates a Session
        ↓
CREATED state
  (config loaded, nothing running)
        ↓
User calls /sessions/{id}/start
        ↓
RUNNING state
  (precision gates initialized, simulation advancing)
        ↓
User can pause/resume/stop
        ↓
PAUSED or STOPPED state
  (final state saved)
        ↓
User exports results
        ↓
Consciousness metrics, state history, etc.
```

### Data Flow Example

**Scenario**: User wants to run a simulation where a visual stimulus is expected vs. unexpected.

1. **User creates Session**
   ```json
   {
     "config": {
       "allostatic_model": "visual_prediction",
       "stimulus_expectation": 0.8,
       "base_precision_gate": 0.3
     }
   }
   ```

2. **System initializes APGI state**
   - Sets precision gate to 0.3 (low attention baseline)
   - Loads allostatic model for visual prediction
   - Initializes network connections

3. **User creates Task** (submit stimulus)
   ```json
   {
     "task_type": "apply_stimulus",
     "parameters": {
       "stimulus": "visual_flash",
       "expected": true
     }
   }
   ```

4. **System runs Task**
   - Computes: is stimulus predicted?
   - Updates precision gate (if expected: 0.3→0.5, if unexpected: 0.3→0.8)
   - Runs simulation step forward
   - Checks for ignition events

5. **User retrieves results**
   - State history shows precision gates opening/closing
   - Consciousness level over time
   - Synchronized network regions

## Key Insights

### Why This Model?

APGI explains several important phenomena:

1. **Attentional Blink**: Why we miss the second of two rapid stimuli
   - After first stimulus, precision gates close (predictive filtering)
   - Second stimulus gets gated out

2. **Cocktail Party Effect**: How we focus on one conversation in noise
   - Precision gates open for conversation-relevant frequencies
   - Noise frequencies remain gated out
   - If someone says your name, gates open dynamically

3. **Consciousness of Action**: Why we're aware of chosen actions but not automatic ones
   - Voluntary actions: high precision, gated through
   - Automatic actions: low precision, filtered out

4. **Dreams and Hallucinations**: Why internal signals can feel like perception
   - Precision gating based on predictions, not bottom-up signals
   - In dreams, predictions dominate (no sensory input to gate)

### Testing the Model

We test APGI by:
1. **Parameter variation**: Change configuration, see what consciousness metrics result
2. **Stimulus manipulation**: Apply different stimuli, measure gating responses
3. **Comparison to data**: Do predictions match brain imaging, behavioral measures?
4. **Edge cases**: What happens at extreme parameter values?

In this course, you'll build the infrastructure to test APGI computationally.

## Formalization (Optional Deep Dive)

If you want the mathematical formulation (not required for coding):

```
Let:
- R(t) = activity vector of brain regions at time t
- G(t) = precision gate vector at time t
- P(t) = predictive model state at time t
- Ω = integration metric

Then APGI consciousness is approximately:

C(t) = Ω(R(t) ⊙ G(t), P(t))

Where ⊙ is element-wise multiplication (gating)
```

**Interpretation**:
- Brain activity R(t) is modified by gating G(t)
- The gated activity integrates with predictions P(t)
- Integration Ω measures how synchronized the result is
- This produces consciousness level C(t)

## Glossary

## Summary

APGI is a neuroscientific theory of consciousness that emphasizes:
1. **Allostasis**: The brain predicts and anticipates
2. **Precision Gating**: Selective information filtering based on predictions
3. **Ignition**: Synchronized network activation
4. **Emergence**: Consciousness arises from this dynamic process

In our API, we implement APGI as a computational system where:
- Sessions represent APGI simulations
